In the year 2018 the world stands on the bring of international armageddon...

North Korean Premier Kim Jong-Un has his button on the trigger after one too many jabs from Australia's Prime Minister Malware Turnbull.

Only three people can stop him...

Play as Japan's Shinzo Abe, China's Xi Jinping, before the final round as Donald Trump of the USA as you attempt to intercept nuclear launches at secret cities across the North Korean peninsula.

Have you got the goods.

Level 1:
Easy

Level 2:
Medium

Level 3: 
Hard

Can't beat any level nuclear apocalype and Kim Jong-Un laughing manically.
